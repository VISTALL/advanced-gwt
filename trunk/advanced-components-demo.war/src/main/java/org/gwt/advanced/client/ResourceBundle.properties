editableGridDemo=This demo shows how to use the Editable Grid with client (browser) side sorting and paging.<br/> \
  The sample assumes that all data has been loaded into the grid and a user has a deal with the data snapshot. \
  Data synchronization can be done whenever you want on any event.  
hierarchicalGridDemo=The similar sample with the diaplyed on the first tab. The difference is that it demostrates \
  Hierarchical Grid implementation and uses hierarchical data model. Subgrids (and grid panels as well) are generated \
  by custom factories. To show Grid Panel and Grid Toolbar customization features the top tollbar in the main grid is hidden.
lazyGridDemo=This is a demo illustrating lazy loadable data model usage. All data displayed in the grid must be \
  synchronized via custom DataModelCallbackHandler implementation. This class must refresh data and save \
  changes into any persistence storage on events pruduced by the data model.<br/> Note, this sample loads / removes just the current \
  page items on the &quot;Remove All&quot; event whereas the first sample works with all items stored in the data model.
masterDetailDemo=This sample shows how the master-detail panel can be used instead of the hierarchical grid. The grid above \
  contains a list of departments. The second grid under the first one) is a list of employees who belong to a selected \
  department. Change row selection in the first grid to see how thw second list refreshes.
otherControlsDemo=This demo shows how to use other controls like combo boxes, date pickers and suggestion boxes. Note that you \
  can insert all these components in grid cells. The standard library provides appropriate implementations.
