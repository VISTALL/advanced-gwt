editableGridDemo=This demo shows how to use the Editable Grid with client (browser) side sorting and paging.<br/> \
  The sample assumes that all data has been loaded into the grid and a user has a deal with the data snapshot. \
  Data synchronization can be done on any event whenever you want.<br/> The grid also allows selecting groups of rows \
  using Ctrl and Shift keys. Selecting at least one row you can perform opertions enabled in the grid toolbar. 
hierarchicalGridDemo=The similar sample with the diaplyed on the first tab. The difference is that it demostrates \
  Hierarchical Grid implementation and uses hierarchical data model. Subgrids (and grid panels as well) are generated \
  by custom factories. To demonstrate Grid Panel and Grid Toolbar customization features the top tollbar in the main grid is hidden.
lazyGridDemo=This is a demo illustrating lazy loadable data model usage. All data displayed in the grid must be \
  synchronized via custom DataModelCallbackHandler implementation. This class must refresh data and save \
  changes into any persistence storage on events pruduced by the data model.<br/> Note, this sample loads / removes just the current \
  page items on the &quot;Remove All&quot; event whereas the first sample works with all items stored in the data model.<br/> \
  The trivial implementation of the callback handler restores data from the back end model and doesn't save changes. 
masterDetailDemo=This sample shows how the master-detail panel can be used instead of the hierarchical grid. The grid above \
  contains a list of departments. The second grid (under the first one) is a list of employees who belong to a selected \
  department. Change row selection in the first grid to see how the second list is refreshed.
otherControlsDemo=This demo shows how to use other controls like combo boxes, date pickers and suggestion boxes. Note that you \
  can insert all these components in grid cells. The standard library provides appropriate wrapper implementations. 
treeGridDemo=This demo sample displays the tree grid. It's able to do the same operations like other grids but supports \
  tree structure entities rendering. Expand and collapse rows to see how it works. Some root rows have pagers. Click left and right \
  arrows to switch pages of the subtrees.
bordersDemo=This tab demonstrates basic borders functionality. Borders can have rounded corners and drop shadows, can be \
  nested into each other. As other widgets their look & feel depends on theme settings.
simpleGridDemo=This tab shows a SimpleGrid sample. SimpleGrid is a basic widget for the other grids of the library. \
  It doesn't support data models but provides basic functionality like columns resizing and body content scrolling.
mvpDemo=This Model-View-Presenter sample shows how data model updates can affect grid view. You can change texts in the boxes above to \
  implicitly update values in the selected row below. Try to play with data model events selecting different rows and \
  changing the values.
